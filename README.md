# Deblinder
User Script / Firefox addon for deblurring tinder likes

## Extra credits!
This source code was partially based on the following script: https://github.com/ChristopherProject/BetterTinder-Deblur-2023

## How to install
### Firefox install
1. make sure you run Firefox Nightly or Developer Edition
2. Go to about:config
3. Set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false`
4. Grab the latest `xpi` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Naamloos/Deblinder/releases) tab.
5. Drag and drop the XPI into your firefox window.
6. Open Tinder, go to your likes and click the convenient `Deblur Likes` button in the bottom right.

### Userscript install
1. Install a userscript manager. (TamperMonkey works well for Chromium-based browsers!)
2. Copy all the text on the following page: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Naamloos/Deblinder/master/src/deblinder.js
3. Create a new script in your UserScript manager
4. Paste all content
5. Open Tinder, go to your likes and click the convenient `Deblur Likes` button in the bottom right.

## Why the name?
"Tinder" + "Deblur" = Deblinder, which is an accurate name since it "deblinds" your likes.

## Screenshot
For privacy of the (many many many (just kidding)) girls in my likes I won't show off any clips of the tool in action, but this is a screenshot of the menu that appears at the bottom right of your screen (as of v1.0):
