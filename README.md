## How to install
### Firefox install
1. make sure you run Firefox Nightly or Developer Edition
2. Go to about:config
3. Set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false`
4. Grab the latest `xpi` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Naamloos/Deblinder/releases) tab.

### Userscript install

## Why the name?
"Tinder" + "Deblur" = Deblinder, which is an accurate name since it "deblinds" your likes.

## Screenshot
For privacy of the (many many many (just kidding)) girls in my likes I won't show off any clips of the tool in action, but this is a screenshot of the menu that appears at the bottom right of your screen (as of v1.0):
